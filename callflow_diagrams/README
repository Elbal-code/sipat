What is this
------------

XSL template for conversion simple XML call flow description into SVG format.

Purpose
-------

This template was written after some hours spent with attempts to draw few
call flow diagrams in umbrello (it will be nice software but now is REALLY
unusable - unstable, unable to edit once drawn pictures, strange behaviour
sometimes, ...). 

In comparison with umbrello is this solution (XML -> SVG) much better. 
Really. ;-) You can use XML features like xincludes and many other (see
examples directory).

Call flow diagram description
-----------------------------

Simple diagram:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<flow width="297" height="210" scale="1">
	<objects>
		<object name="a" desc="a:client" x="20" y="200"/>
		<object name="b" desc="b:client" x="80" y="200"/>
		<object name="xcap" desc="XCAP" x="250" y="200"/>
		<object name="ps" desc="Presence server" x="150" y="200"/>
	</objects>
	
	<call src="a" dst="ps" desc="SUBSCRIBE" color="green"/>
	<call src="ps" dst="xcap" desc="GET (authorization doc)" sync="true"/>
	<call src="ps" desc="STORE message"/>
	<call src="ps" desc="STORE message(sync)" sync="true"/>
	<call src="ps" dst="a" desc="NOTIFY" color="red"/>
	<call src="a" dst="ps" desc="200 OK" color="red"/>
	
	<call src="ps" dst="b" desc="winfo NOTIFY"/>
	<call src="b" dst="ps" desc="200 OK"/>
</flow>

In <objects> section we define actors. Each actor has "name", which identifies him
in <call> elements; description desc" which is shown in title; "x" position which
means the horizontal position in mm of actor's line on the diagram and "y" which
means the length of actor's line ("y" is deprecated now - it is automaticaly 
computed).

After that we simply use <call> elements where:
  src   ... name of call source actor
  dst   ... name of call destination actor (if missing, it is a "selfcall" - call 
            done to ator itself; may be missing together with given sync)
  desc  ... description shown over the call arrow
  color ... color of call arrow (if not given, black is used)
  sync  ... the call is drawn as synchronous call (rectangle and response arrow)

Usage
-----

Converting call flow diagram into SVG using a XSLT processor (for example
xsltproc):

   xsltproc --xinclude -o diagram.svg cf.xsl diagram.xml

Such SVG image can be displayed in browser using plugin from Adobe or 
converted into other format using for example GIMP.

Converting SVG into PNG using GIMP is described by Matthew Gates in 
http://www.porpoisehead.net/mysw/index.php?pgid=gimp_svg.

There is a simple Makefile in example directory using this conversion and scripts
published on web page mentioned above. It works with GIMP 2.2 with SVG plugin without
much effort. 

Try it:

  cd examples
  make
